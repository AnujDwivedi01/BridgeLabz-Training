# Week 6: Java 8 features
## 📅 Day 1 – Lambda Expression, Functional Interface, Method reference and Marker Interface
(Date: 27-01-2026) (Focus: Functional Programming Enhancements in Java 8)

Studied Java 8 functional programming concepts to write cleaner, more expressive, and efficient Java code.

Learned Lambda Expressions to reduce boilerplate code and implement functional interfaces in a concise manner.

Explored Functional Interfaces such as Runnable, Callable, Comparator, and custom functional interfaces using @FunctionalInterface.

Practiced Method References (static, instance, and constructor references) to improve readability and reuse existing methods.

Understood the concept of Marker Interfaces and how they provide metadata to the JVM without defining methods.

Applied Java 8 features in practical examples to simplify logic, improve maintainability, and follow modern Java coding standards.

Focused on building a strong foundation for Streams API, collections processing, and functional-style programming.

## 📅 Day 2 – Java Stream API

(Date: 29-01-2026)

Learned and practiced Java 8 Stream API for functional-style collection processing.

Worked with key Stream operations such as filter(), map(), sorted(), limit(), and forEach().

Solved multiple real-world problems using streams to filter, transform, sort, and log data efficiently.

Focused on using forEach() for logging, notifications, and real-time data processing.

Improved code readability and maintainability using modern Java 8 features.
