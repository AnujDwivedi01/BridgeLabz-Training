- Learned basic Git commands (init, branch, checkout, add, commit, push).
- Successfully pushed files to the remote repository.

 ## 📅 Day 2 – Git Practice & Basic Java Programs   
*(Date: 16-Dec-2025)*
*(Focus: Writing Clean & Professional Java Code)*

- Practiced Git workflow to understand commits and version control.
- Solved very basic Java programs to understand syntax and structure.
- Practiced adding, committing, and pushing Java files to GitHub.

- Started writing Java code in a *professional and industry-standard manner*, following:
  - Proper *naming conventions* (class names, variables, methods)
  - Clean and readable *indentation*
  - Meaningful *comments* for better understanding
  - Structured and consistent *code formatting*

- Gained hands-on experience in organizing programs for better *maintainability and readability*.

- All practice programs were stored systematically under the program-prerequisite module.

## 📅 Day 4 – Control Flows  
*(Date: 18-Dec-2025)*
*(Logic Building with Conditional & Looping Constructs)*

- Worked on *Java Control Flow statements* to strengthen logical thinking.
- Practice problems were categorized into *three levels*:
  - *Level 1*: Basic conditional statements (if, if-else)
  - *Level 2*: Looping constructs (for, while, do-while)
  - *Level 3*: Combined logic-based and pattern-oriented problems

- Emphasized writing *clean, readable, and structured code*.
- All programs were organized under the control-flow folder in gcr-codebase.
