🚀 BridgeLabz Training: Java Fellowship

This repository tracks my daily progress, assignments, and coding challenges during the BridgeLabz Professional Training program.

# 📅 Week 1: Git, GitHub & Java Fundamentals

## 📅 Day 1: Environment Setup & Version Control
**Date:** December 15, 2025

### ✅ Tasks Completed:
* **Git Configuration:** Successfully installed and configured Git locally.
* **Repository Management:** Initialized the local repository and linked it to the remote GitHub account.
* **Workflow Mastery:** Practiced the core Git lifecycle: `init`, `branch`, `checkout`, `add`, `commit`, and `push`.

## 📅 Day 2: Clean Coding & Java Basics
Date: 16-Dec-2025

✅ Highlights

Git Workflow: Mastered the cycle of adding, committing, and pushing Java files.

Basic Java: Developed initial programs focusing on syntax and logic.
Professional Standards: Applied industry-standard naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase), clean indentation, and meaningful comments.
Organization: Categorized all code within the programming-elements module for better maintainability.

## 📅 Day 3: Java Programming Elements
Date: 17-Dec-2025

✅ Highlights

Core Concepts: Explored Variables, Data Types, Operators, and I/O handling.
Practice: Solved foundational problems to implement basic logic and user interaction.
Git: Successfully committed and pushed all solutions to the remote repository.

## 📅 Day 4 – Control Flows  
*(Date: 18-Dec-2025)*
*(Logic Building with Conditional & Looping Constructs)*

- Worked on *Java Control Flow statements* to strengthen logical thinking.
- Practice problems were categorized into *three levels*:
  - *Level 1*: Basic conditional statements (if, if-else)
  - *Level 2*: Looping constructs (for, while, do-while)
  - *Level 3*: Combined logic-based and pattern-oriented problems

- Emphasized writing *clean, readable, and structured code*.
- All programs were organized under the control-flow folder in gcr-codebase.

## 📅 Day 5 – Java Arrays 
*(Date:19-Dec-2025)*
*(Data Storage & Manipulation Techniques)*

- Learned and practiced *Java Arrays* for handling collections of data.
- Problems were divided into *two levels*:
  - *Level 1*: Basic array creation, traversal, and input/output
  - *Level 2*: Logical problems such as searching, counting, and data manipulation

- Followed proper *coding standards* with consistent indentation and naming conventions.
- Programs were stored under the arrays folder in gcr-codebase.

## 📅 Day 6: Java Methods & Modular Design
Date: 20-Dec-2025

✅ Highlights

Modular Coding: Mastered Method design to ensure code reusability and clarity.

Tiered Practice: Solved 3 levels of complexity:

Level 1: Basic definition and invocation.
Level 2: Implementation of parameters and return types.
Level 3: Complex logic using multi-method interaction.

Structure: Organized all solutions in a new methods folder within gcr-codebase.

## 📅 Day 7: Java String Manipulation
Date: 22-Dec-2025

✅ Highlights

String Concepts: Explored memory allocation (String Pool), immutability, and core string operations.

Tiered Practice:

Level 1: Creation, basic methods, and comparison techniques.
Level 2: Manipulation at the character level.
Level 3: Advanced logical problem-solving using strings.

Organization: Created and populated the strings folder under gcr-codebase.
