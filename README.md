## 📅 Day 9 – Java OOPS: Class & Object
(Date: 26-Dec-2025)
(Focus: Core OOPS Fundamentals – Classes and Objects)

Learned the fundamental concepts of classes and objects in Java.

Understood how a class defines data and behavior, while objects represent real-world instances.

Practiced defining classes with variables and methods, and creating multiple objects from them.

Gained better understanding of object interaction through method calls.

Emphasized writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

Systematically organized all Class & Object programs in the java-oops-practice branch.

## 📅 Day 10 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts

(Date: 27-Dec-2025)
(Focus: Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables & Methods)

Learned how constructors are used to initialize objects in Java.

Practiced implementing default and parameterized constructors.

Understood the difference between instance variables and static (class-level) variables.

Observed how static variables share data across multiple objects.

Learned the use of instance methods versus static methods.

Gained clarity on accessing instance members through objects and static members through class names.

Followed clean coding practices with proper naming, formatting, and indentation.

Organized all constructor and static-related programs in the java-oops-practice branch.
