## 📅 Day 9 – Java OOPS: Class & Object
(Date: 26-Dec-2025)
(Focus: Core OOPS Fundamentals – Classes and Objects)

Learned the fundamental concepts of classes and objects in Java.

Understood how a class defines data and behavior, while objects represent real-world instances.

Practiced defining classes with variables and methods, and creating multiple objects from them.

Gained better understanding of object interaction through method calls.

Emphasized writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

Systematically organized all Class & Object programs in the java-oops-practice branch.

## 📅 Day 10 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts

(Date: 27-Dec-2025)
(Focus: Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables & Methods)

Learned how constructors are used to initialize objects in Java.

Practiced implementing default and parameterized constructors.

Understood the difference between instance variables and static (class-level) variables.

Observed how static variables share data across multiple objects.

Learned the use of instance methods versus static methods.

Gained clarity on accessing instance members through objects and static members through class names.

Followed clean coding practices with proper naming, formatting, and indentation.

Organized all constructor and static-related programs in the java-oops-practice branch.

## 📅 Day 11 – Java OOPS: Core Java Keywords ##

**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: static, final, this, instanceof)**

-> Studied essential Java keywords and their role in OOPS-based programming.

-> Understood the use of static keyword for class-level variables, methods, and shared behavior.

-> Learned how final keyword is used to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes.

-> Practiced using this keyword to refer to the current object and resolve ambiguity between instance variables and parameters.

-> Gained clarity on the instanceof operator to check object type at runtime.

-> Implemented small programs to observe how these keywords affect object behavior and memory usage.

-> Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

-> Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

-> Organized all keyword-based programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.
