# Week 4: Java Collections

## 📅 Day 1 – Java Collections & Generics
Date: 17-01-2026

Practiced Java Collections and Generics by solving scenario-based problems using generic classes, bounded type parameters, generic methods, and wildcards.

Implemented systems for warehouse management, online marketplace, university course handling, and meal plan generation, focusing on type safety, reusability, and clean code structure.

Programs were organized under the Java Collections & Generics module.

## 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections: List, Set, Map & Queue
Date: 19-01-2026

Worked on core Java Collection interfaces including List, Set, Map, and Queue, understanding their structure, behavior, and use cases.

Implemented programs using ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap, and Queue, focusing on data storage, ordering, and retrieval.

Practiced real-world scenarios to compare collections based on performance, ordering, uniqueness, and access patterns.

Organized all programs under the Java Collections module with clean, readable code.

## 📅 Day 3 – Java File Handling & I/O Streams
(Date: 21-01-2026) (Focus: File Handling, Buffered Streams, Serialization & Advanced I/O)

Studied Java File Handling and I/O Streams to understand how Java reads and writes data using byte and character streams.

Learned the difference between basic file streams and buffered streams, and how buffering improves performance for large file operations.

Practiced reading user input from the console and writing structured data into files using reader and writer classes.

Explored object serialization and deserialization to store and retrieve Java objects using ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream.

Worked with ByteArray streams, data streams, piped streams, and large-file processing to handle real-world I/O scenarios efficiently.
