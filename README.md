# Week 7 : Java Design Pattern

## 📅 Day 1 – SOLID Principles & Design Patterns (Java)
Date: 2-02-2026
Focus: Object-Oriented Design, Clean Code & Scalable Architecture in Java

Studied Java Design Principles (SOLID) to write clean, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented code.

Learned the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and understood how separating responsibilities makes code easier to modify, test, and maintain.

Explored the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) to design classes that are open for extension but closed for modification using abstraction and polymorphism.

Understood the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) and how incorrect inheritance can break application behavior.

Practiced the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) by designing small, focused interfaces instead of large, monolithic ones.

Learned the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) to reduce tight coupling by depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

Introduced Design Patterns and understood their importance in solving common software design problems using proven approaches.

Implemented Creational Design Patterns such as:

Singleton

Factory Method

Abstract Factory

Prototype

Implemented Structural & Behavioral Design Patterns such as:

Adapter

Builder

Strategy

Applied real-world Java examples to understand when and why to use each design principle and pattern.

Focused on writing loosely coupled, extensible, and testable code following industry-level Java design standards.

## 📅 Day 2 – Java Multithreading
Date: 04-02-2026  Focus: Concurrent Programming & Thread Management in Java

Studied Java Multithreading to understand concurrent execution and improve application performance.

Learned the thread lifecycle and different ways to create threads using Thread, Runnable, and Callable.

Practiced synchronization using synchronized methods/blocks and understood thread safety concepts.

Explored inter-thread communication using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().

Learned about common concurrency problems such as race conditions and deadlocks.

Introduced thread pools using ExecutorService for efficient task execution.

Understood Daemon Threads and basic utilities from java.util.concurrent.

Applied practical examples to write safe and efficient multithreaded code following Java best practices.
